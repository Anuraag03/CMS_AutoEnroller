# CMS_AutoEnroller
A Python Script that automates the enrolling process of the course management system of BITS Pilani Hyd Campus

This program uses the Selenium module of python majorly to automate the entire process of enrolling into the CMS
You can find a .exe named ***cms_enroller.exe*** in the ***dist/cms_enroller*** directory to run the script as an executable file without requiring to import modules or using an IDE
